# TODO App Starter

![Design preview for the Todo app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible using Next.js.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

TODO Items should be stored in a database, and should persist between page reloads.
To provision a temporary Postgres database you can use [Neon Database](https://neon.tech/).

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
